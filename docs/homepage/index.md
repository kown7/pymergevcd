## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kown7/pymergevcd/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Create documents

These documents are regenerated on every push. The assets folder need to be in the repository, otherwise it's ignored by travis' deploy script.

To set a released document create an annotated tag, e.g., for version `1A` use `git tag -a SWC-RS/1A`. Alternatively use the same tags that are used for the release of the software. This will unfortunately lead to what can seem as outdated documents.

### Jekyll Themes
